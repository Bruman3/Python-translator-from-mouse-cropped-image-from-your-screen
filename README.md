# Python-translator-from-mouse-cropped-image-from-your-screen
Start the program, hold down your mouse and drag to create a rectangle, press c so it will become a separate image. 
After that pytesseract (ps. follow a youtube video to properly install it, unless the program will not work) will extract text from the image.
Where it is translated by googletrans (remember to paste this 'pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0'into your terminal, or it will not work)
Do not use this program for complex languages such as arabic, hindi, russian etc or any language that has "strange" symbols/ letters that does not fit in the english alphabet, due to pytesseract.


This is a small project to aid those in languages in unselect able/ unhighlightable documents.
