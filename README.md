# Python-translator-from-mouse-cropped-image-from-your-screen
Start the program, hold down your mouse and drag to create a rectangle, press c so it will become a separate image. 
After that pytesseract (ps. follow a youtube video to properly install it, unless the program will not work) will extract text from the image
where it is translated by googletrans (remember to paste this 'pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0'into your terminal, or it will not work), do not use this program for complex languages such as arabic, hindi, etc
This is a small project to aid those in languages in unselect able/ highlightable documents.
